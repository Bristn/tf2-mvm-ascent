The gameplay of the map can be changed using the [b]InitWaveOutput[/b] in the .pop files. The table shows the different relays and their actions.

[table]
[tr]
[th]Relay[/th]
[th]Description[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]relay_advance_sequence_n[/td]
[td]Advances the sequence by n steps[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]relay_advance_sequence_n_abort[/td]
[td]Advances the sequence by n steps and aborts it right after[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]relay_abort_sequence[/td]
[td]Aborts the sequence without advancing[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td]relay_idle_sequence[/td]
[td]Does not alter the sequence [/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

⚠️ If any [b]relay_advance_[/b] or [b]relay_abort_[/b] are used, [b]all[/b] waves must define a [b]InitWaveOutput[/b] action. If the sequence should not change use [b]relay_idle_sequence[/b].

Tthe actions are always executed before the wave. Defining [b]relay_advance_sequence_1[/b] in the first wave will result in the first step being executed immediately after the map loads. Advancing the sequence triggers the steps one after another. The sequence consists of the following 5 steps.

The second outlet of the upper dam is closed. The entire water channel is drained. Bots may chose the channel as a secondary path jumping down from the bridge. The channel path has a higher chance to be chosen compared to the regular path, as it is shorter and harder to defend.

All water is drained from the lake. The death pit remains, but bots are no longer sucked into the death pit. Bots and tanks can chose the channel path. Like before, the channel path has a higher chance to be chosen compared to the regular path.

The outlet of the lower dam is closed. This removed the death pit completely.

Aborting the sequence stops further steps from executing, locking the current state for the remainder of the game. Additionally a new bot spawn point is enabled, making the starter area harder to defend.

Gatebots can capture a control point near the lift. Once captured, the lift is lowered enabling a shortcut for bots and tanks. After a tank uses the lift, the shortcut is closed and the control point is reset.
